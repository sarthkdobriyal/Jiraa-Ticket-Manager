# Jiraa Ticket Management Tool
Jiraa is a ticket management tool designed to help you store, prioritize and fix bugs and errors by listing them down using tickets. This tool is built using HTML, CSS and vanilla JavaScript and is perfect for developers who want to keep track of their projects and collaborate with their teams more efficiently.

# Features
- Create a new ticket by clicking the add button, then type the text and click on one of the color codes on the right to save the ticket with a unique ID.
- Tickets can also be saved by pressing the ENTER key, and by default, the priority is black.
- On the navbar, color codes are shown. Clicking on any one of the colors will result in viewing tickets with that color code only. On double-clicking, it will display all the tickets.
- Each ticket contains a bar at the top that shows its priority by showing the color code. On clicking it, the priority can be toggled.
- Each ticket contains a lock button, which can be toggled if the content inside the ticket needs to be changed.
- The priority color codes with decreasing priority levels are as follows: pink > blue > green > black.
- Any ticket can be deleted by clicking on the delete button (right next to the Add button) and then clicking on any ticket that needs to be deleted. When done deleting the tickets, click the delete button to turn it off.
- The tickets are stored in the local storage provided by the browser, so closing the browser or reloading the page will not have any effect on the tickets. The tickets will be saved and shown whenever it is opened again.
